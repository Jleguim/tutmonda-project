# Tutmonda
Tutmonda is a **Discord Bot** programmed in **NodeJS** using the official [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js "Discord.js") npm libraries aswell as [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose "Mongoose")([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/ "MongoDB")) as its backend.

#### Why the name?
Tutmonda means Global in [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto"), we wanted this bot to cover very general stuff so it was perfect. It's also a funny name considering we're Colombian lol.
